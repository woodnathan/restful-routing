Basic usage:

	public override void Map(Mapper map)
	{
		map.Root<HomeController>(x => x.Show());
		map.Path("test/{id}").To<TestController>(x => x.Test()).Constrain("id", @"\d+");
		map.Resource<SessionsController>();
		map.Resources<BlogsController>(blogs =>
		{
			blogs.As("weblogs");
			blogs.Only("index", "show");
			blogs.Collection(x => {
				x.Get("latest");
				x.Post("someaction");
			);
			blogs.Member(x => x.Put("move"));

			blogs.Resources<PostsController>(posts =>
			{
				posts.Except("create", "update", "destroy");
				posts.Resources<CommentsController>(c => c.Except("destroy"));
			});
		});
	}
}

public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
	protected void Application_Start()
	{
		ViewEngines.Engines.Clear();
		ViewEngines.Engines.Add(new RestfulRoutingViewEngine());
		
		RouteTable.Routes.MapRoutes<Routes>();
	}
}</code></pre>
